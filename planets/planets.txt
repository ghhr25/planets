we have the following planets:
mercury
venus
earth 
mars
jupiter
saturn
uranus
neptune
pluto
we also have the sedna which is a replacement for pluto because 
pluto is not a planet anymore
But there are also a lot of other planets that still, TO THIS DAY, remain UN-DISCOVERED!! 
We , at the moment have only discovered about 0.001% of the total universe!!
Yet some organisations such as NASA and ISRO are pushing the limits to what was known as the 
possible human barrier.
